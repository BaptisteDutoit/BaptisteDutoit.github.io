                        <p class="normal">During the summer of 2023, from May to July, Baptiste embarked on a professional experience
                         in total immersion in Germany as part of the International Break (IB) imposed by HEI.
                         The IB is a period during which each student must go to work outside France in order to
                         to gain professional experience, discover new cultures and change your way
                         to see the world at the same time.<br><br>Determined to drastically improve his level in German,
                         it is therefore quite natural that Baptiste chooses to direct his destination towards the homeland of thinkers and
                         poets ("das Land der Dichter und Denker"), in other words Germany. After several months of research and
                         numerous interviews, he will end up being hired for a period of 2 months in the most famous
                         European amusement park, Europa-Park, and more precisely in a 4-star-superior hotel, the Hotel
                         Colosseo.<br><br>Concerning the purely professional part, these schedules were mainly planned
                         in the morning from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., 5 days a week. He took care of receiving clients of all nationalities, designating them
                         a table and finally take their order. It was an excellent linguistic strengthening exercise for him.<br><br>
                         For the extra-professional part, Baptiste lived alone in a tent in a border campsite on the other side of the Rhine, in Rhinau.
                         In order to get to work at 7 a.m., he had to get up at 5:30 a.m. and cycle for an hour. Conditions far from ideal, of course, but
                         nevertheless extremely formative for his future life; he repeated to himself all the time that to win without danger, we
                         triumph without glory. He finally returned to France at the end of July 2023, having gained a wonderful experience.</p>

                         His objective was to prepare orders for pharmacies, carry out stock inventories and clean the warehouse. A very educational experience

                         From the graphic development of the universe to the computer code of video games, all areas were presented to him.
                         During this internship Baptiste fell in love with the field of IT development and application creation. It is not only

                         among the workers of tomorrow. This is why, during his studies at HEI, Baptiste was heavily involved in the associative life of his school.<br><br>
                         He was first of all the Vice-President of the Las'heir Game association, which, as its name suggests, aims to organize Laser Game games.
                         at advantageous prices between HEI students only. It is a small association (2 people) which therefore trains these 2 representatives in many areas

                         Subsequently, he joined Winnie Whei, the school's integration association, in which he held the position of secretary. He learned a lot there

                         Villeneuve d'Ascq Métropole in u10, which would later become his favorite club. His integration was quick and efficient since he was upgraded to a higher category in his first year
                         and even obtained the captain's armband which he kept until he stopped playing club football to devote himself 100% to his studies. Subsequently, he will return to the field by joining team 1 of JUNIA HEI.<br><br>
                         His role as captain brought him a lot of things, including taking responsibility at a very young age, <span class="Bold">communication skills</span> on and in off the field and a <span class="Bold">sense of leadership</span>.
                         <br><br>In addition, playing at a relatively high level (Regional 2), allowed him to further develop his <span class="Bold">competitive spirit</span> and his propensity to always want

                         These stints as a coach gave him a broader vision from a footballing point of view, but also deep <span class="Bold">team management skills.</p>

                        <p class="normal">As part of his course at HEI, Baptiste must apply his skills acquired in town planning, energy and mobility by carrying out this rehabilitation project
                         from the Edard site in Croix. This site was once a former textile industrial zone but is now largely abandoned. The objective of this project is therefore firstly to give back
                         a second life for this historic site by taking into account the environment that surrounds it. However, certain constraints apply to this project. Indeed, this site must contain at least 4000 m² of offices, restaurants and other
                         types of service, but also 215 housing units (76 social housing and 139 owner housing). The objective here is to create a multi-use site with a connection between residents
                         and activities. As you can see in these photos and this QGIS map that he created, the site is located in the city center and the buildings around are mainly composed
                         of red bricks. The advantage is that the location of this site already allows it to offer various activities and an easy connection to the metro and buses,
                         on the other hand, the objective here will be to revitalize this site so that it impacts this aging area of Croix.</p>

                        <p class="normal">The project is being completed today and is called "Vies Croixées" in reference to the desire to bring together the inhabitants and workers of this site through
                         the establishment of different activities (restaurants, gym and a cyber café equipped with an arcade room), public spaces (co-working and shared balconies) and
                         exterior facilities (kiosk, lake and common gardens).<br><br>Concerning the constructions carried out, the site is being implemented, in compliance with the Local Urban Planning Plan (PLU)
                         8 new buildings, some equipped with parking lots and underground spaces. As you can see on the AutoCad plans, they are oriented towards the south in order to exploit
                         maximum natural solar resources (light and heat).<br><br> These buildings have a strong particularity within the framework of "Vies Croixées", it is an exterior glass facade like
                         you can see it in the photo. It is a double skin which allows on the one hand to create a common space between the different inhabitants of a building, and on the other hand allows to improve thermal insulation
                         and to better manage the brightness according to the position of the sun and the different orientations of the building.</p>

                        <p class="normal">In order to develop smarter cities, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is essential.<br>
                         Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a digital modeling method that makes it possible to design, build and manage urban infrastructure in a collaborative and coordinated manner. By integrating geospatial data, material information, costs and performance, BIM provides a detailed and accurate virtual representation of a project, allowing those involved to better visualize and understand every aspect of the project.<br>< br>This approach promotes better coordination between the different stakeholders, reduces errors and construction costs, and allows more efficient management throughout the life cycle of an urban infrastructure.<br><br>
                         In a context of smart and resilient cities, where sustainability, resource management and resilience to crises are essential, BIM becomes an essential tool for designing and managing more efficient and sustainable cities.<br><br>
                         This is why in the Master "Smart and Resilient Cities", BIM courses are taught where students carry out 3D modeling with <span class="Bold">Revit/Autocad</span>.
                         These 2 different projects were carried out by Baptiste, with the help of plans provided by Professor Rania Wehbi.</p>

                        <p class="normal">The Threading House is a project which aims to develop a circular economy system for
                         cities that want to be more resilient. This concept is oriented around textiles because today, people buy 60% more clothes than 15 years ago
                         and we keep these clothes half as long. In addition, 95% of textile waste is recyclable!<br><br>The concept is simple: The Threading House is a boutique
                         clothing repair which aims to encourage recycling, DIY and the circular economy. On the one hand, people wanting to repair their clothes can come and learn how to repair
                         imperfections or even personalize their clothes. On the other hand, people can come and give us back those that they no longer like in exchange for reduction vouchers in
                         partner stores. Then these clothes are sent by The Threading House to sorting centers which will pay us for this and will send these sorted textiles
                         will serve as raw materials for factories manufacturing various objects based on recycled textiles which will in turn be sold in other stores. There
                         The loop is closed thanks to this project from The Threading House. Do not hesitate to watch the video produced by Baptiste Dutoit. It would be also an opportunity to hear his wonderful <span class="barre">french</span> english accent.</p>

                         around a theme of innovative rainwater recovery.<br><br>After intensive brainstorming, the main idea retained is to generate, using the fall

                         such as <span class="Boold">Resistance of Materials</span> but above all skills in <span class="Bold">Project Management</span>.<br><br>This project was an experience
